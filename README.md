Let's say you're visiting Boulder and you want to check out the top 10 restaurants to eat. 
You hop on your mobile device and the top ten restaurants comes up on Trip Advisor. [Here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g33324-Boulder_Colorado.html) is a link that shows the top restaurants to eat in Boulder according to Trip Advisor.

You're not familiar with the area so you want to make sure you don't get food poisoning, and you want to ensure the general cleanliness, so you hop over [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/steven.lutton#!/vizhome/TripAdvisorsTop10RestaurantsbyAverageInspectionScore/Top10Colored) to my Tableau project.

I have the top 10 restaurants according to Trip Advisor ranked by their average inspection score. The lower the score the better. [Here](https://assets.bouldercounty.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/how-to-calculate-inspection-ratings.pdf) and [Here](https://assets.bouldercounty.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CalculateInspectionRatings.pdf) are some links explaining inspection calculations. 

If you would like to dig deeper into the data yourself I have provided my original data set including only CO Restaurants with a 5 digit zip code, and excluding all records showing a 0 or NULL for the inspection points. (Restaurants.csv)

If you would like to download the original dataset you can do so [here](https://data.colorado.gov/Municipal/Restaurant-Inspections-in-Boulder-County-Colorado/tuvj-xz3m)

I have also included CSV's and Excel workbooks with pivot tables for the top 10 restaurants in Boulder, Colorado according to Trip Advisor.com, as well as the dataset where I found the license types (co_liquor_licenses)

I am currently trying to develop an interactive pivot table on my tableau dashboard that will allow you to view any restaurant's inspection details. Once this is operational I will hopefully have filters allowing you to look at any restaurant by violation type (critical and not critical) as well as the inspection type. I would also like to include geographic data at least for the top 10 and color coding according to poor, fair, marginal, good, and excellent.
